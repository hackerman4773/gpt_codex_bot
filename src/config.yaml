      text: Can you explain how to reverse a string in Python?
    - user: Code E Banks
      text: Sure, you can use the `[::-1]` slicing method to reverse a string in Python. Here's an example;
         
         my_string = "hello"
         reversed_string = my_string[::-1]
         print(reversed_string) # outputs "olleh" ```

      text: Sure, you can use the `reverse()` method or the `[::-1]` slicing method to reverse a list in Python. Here's an example;
         
         my_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
         my_list.reverse()
         print(my_list) # outputs [5,4,3,2,1]
